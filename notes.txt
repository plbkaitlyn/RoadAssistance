-Need an index page to load => set a page/web form as a start page
(right click on the aspx file)

*Check for datatype when passing data with large value:
cardNo (16 digits): int (wrong) ==> decimal(MySQL)/float/double(C#)

*Handle date type:
for card expiry date
2 ways:
-divide into 2 separate fields: month and year ==>easiest
-store as float/decimal (3.21): March 2021

-It is possible to insert a value for a AUTO_INCREMENT variable in MySQL
=>after that when a new row is inserted into the table,
the (largest value + 1) will be the next value of that AUTO_INCREMENT variable

-It is possible to update a unique field with the same value
 eg: UPDATE contractor SET license = 12356 WHERE userID = 10;
//old license = 12356
